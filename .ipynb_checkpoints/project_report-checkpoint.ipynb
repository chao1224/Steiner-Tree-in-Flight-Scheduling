Then, elaborate with a description of the problem that will be solved, a brief history (with [citations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citation)) of how the problem came about, why it's important/interesting, and any other interesting facts you'd like to talk about. ?\n",

    "Suppose you have one or two available weeks, and you want to visit some cities in the U.S., especially for international students who just came to U.S., you may have some city list that you would like to visit, also some city list you don't want to pay a visit to. So how you can come up with a travel plan?\n",
    "\n",
    "In our problem, given all the possible cities that we would like to visit, and another must-visit city list. Then under time and expense constraints, we hope to find a route that maximizes the delight index. The delight index is based on the some travel index for each city plus delight index for each air flight. We may need to find a trade-off between these parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make our model more realistic, we fetch real data online. First we take [walk score](https://www.walkscore.com/cities-and-neighborhoods/) to measure each city, which makes sense considering most students like walking while travelling. About flight information, we utilize the [Expedia API](http://hackathon.expedia.com/directory), and calculate the delight index with a fixed function for each flight.\n",

    "\n",
    "### 2.A. Basic Model ###\n",
    "\n",
    "Assumption 1: we assume that flying from one city to another city takes exactly one day, and pay a visit to one city takes exactly two days.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assumption 2: Price didn't change within adjacent several days.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assumption 3: Each city just visit once.\n",
    "\n",
    "First notice we will introduce the incidence matrix $ matrix \\in \\cal{R}^{v \\times e} $ in our model, where $v$ is the number of vertices or cities, and  $e$ is the number of edges, that is two times city number plus flight number(will explain why two time city number later), and $b$ is the supposed  The vector $edge \\in \\cal{R}^{e}$ is the edge choice. So apparently we can get these two contraints:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ matrix \\times edge == b$$, where b is the supposed in- or out- degree for each vertice or city.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ abs(matrix) \\times edge . \\le 2$$, which means the sum of in- and out- degree for each city should be less than or equal to two.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second we need to meet the time and cost limit. Suppose $city\\_choice \\in \\cal{R}^{v}$ is binary value vector, and $city\\_choice[i] = 1$ represents $city[i]$ will be visited, otherwise if $city\\_choice[i] = 0$ will not visit $city[i]$. Same idea for $flight\\_choice$ which represents whether or not taking $flight[i]$. So according to problem, we can get these two limits:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ flight\\_choice' \\times flight\\_price \\le total\\_money $$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ 2sum( city_choice) +  sum(flight\\_choice) \\le total\\_day $$\n",
    "\n",
    "We still have one question not solved, that is why we need $2 \\times city\\_number$. Please consider the graph below, we split each city node into two. The reason we do that is that, suppose $edge$ is composed only by the $flight$, and we meet the constraints. But still, we don't know which city will form a single circle, like the $city_A$ in this graph, which means in the adaptive method, we will detect only one circle( that is $city_B$ - $city_C$ - $city_D$) in the graph, which is absolutely wrong. That's why we want to split each city node into two, because it can help us find all possible circles or subtours in the graph, then applying adaptive method will be reasonable.\n",

    "### 2.B. Bounded Model ###\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we may come up with another idea: in a more realistic scenario, people will have an upper bound travelling day for each city, instead of exactly 2 days, which makes sense because someone just hope to visit several different cities within 2 week-holiday.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assumption: visiting day for each city will be bounded by a upper bound. And the delight index for visiting one city is calculated by the city score multiply by its corresponding visiting day.\n",
    "\n",
    "We introduct a new vector $day\\_each\\_city \\in \\cal{R}^{v}$, denoting the travelling day for each city, and its upper bound is $city\\_day\\_upperlimit$. So apparently we can get following relations:\n",
    "\n",
    "If $city\\_choice[i] = 1$, then $day\\_each\\_city[i] \\ge 1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "If $city\\_choice[i] = 0$, then $day\\_each\\_city[i] == 0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then applying the if-then constraint:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ day\\_each\\_city[i] - 1 \\ge m (1 - city\\_choice[i]) = city\\_choice[i] - 1$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ day\\_each\\_city[i] \\le M day\\_each\\_city[i] = city\\_day\\_upperlimit[i] \\times day\\_each\\_city[i] $$\n",
    "\n",
    "And also we notice that the upper bound for visiting each city $day\\_each\\_city \\le city\\_day\\_upperlimit$ is included in the second if-then constraint, so we don't have to explicitly it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore the standard form for this is below:\n",

    "& day\\_each\\_city[i] - 1 \\ge city\\_choice[i] - 1 \\\\\n",

    "### 2.C. Adaptive Method ###\n",
    "\n",
    "We apply the adaptive subtour elimination. Find subtours and the get the number of subtours. If the subtour number is bigger than one, then we add a constraint that this circle should not be reached, so that we can avoid having multiple circles in the graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "One key tip is that, in our model, since we start our trip from Madison, the out-degree of Madison will be 1, and in-degree of Madison will be -1, in which case this will not form a circle itself. So we have to manually search the subtour starting from the Madison at first in each iteration, so that we can find the very first route starting from Madison and back to Madison.\n",

    "\n",
    "Then we form the $matrix$. As we discussed above, the first $2 city\\_number$ whould describe the city itself, in case we don't want to visit somewhere else. For $city[i]$, we split it into two subnodes, $2i-1$ and $2i$. $2i-1$ is the in-degree node, and $2i$ is the out-degree node. Then add two edges: from $2i-1$ to $2i$ and from $2i$ back to $2i-1$. In this case, we will not miss the single-city circle.\n",

    "And applying our splitting nodes concept for the flight from $city[u]$ to $city[v]$, we should add an edge from $2u$ to $2v-1$.\n",
    "\n",
