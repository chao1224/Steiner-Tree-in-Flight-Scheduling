    "\n",
    "Suppose you have one or two available weeks, and you want to visit some cities in the U.S., especially for international students who just came to U.S., you may have a city list that you would like to visit, also another city list you don't want to pay a visit to. So how you can come up with a travel plan?\n",
    "\n",
    "This question is very similar to TSP([Travelling Salesman Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem)). The Travelling Salesman problem is like this, suppose we have a bunch of cities and we would like visit all of them in a round trip. Target is to get the minimal length or cost of this round trip.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another similar question we can apply here is the [Steiner Tree Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steiner_tree_problem).  Steiner Tree problem can give a spanning tree, which forms a tree out of a complex graph, but under the condition that minimizing the spanning tree cost only cover the must-pass nodes. So if we apply that model into our problem, it's like get a special Steiner 'tree' that starts from the root and ends at root with just one path.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our problem, given all the possible cities that we can choose to visit, and another must-visit city list. Then under time and expense constraints, we hope to find a route that maximizes the delight index. The delight index is based on the some travel index for each city plus delight index for each air flight. We may need to find a trade-off between these parameters. For example, in the graph below, we have twelve cities, and we need to choose which city to start and end with, then also specify all the must-visit cities and must-not-visit cities.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~shengchao/cs524/all_city_map.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "To make our model more realistic, we fetch real data online. First we take [walk score](https://www.walkscore.com/cities-and-neighborhoods/) to measure each city, which makes sense considering most students like walking while travelling. About flight information, we utilize the [Expedia API](http://hackathon.expedia.com/directory), and calculate the delight index with a fixed function for each flight.\n",
    "\n",
    "In part 2, we will first extract a basic model out of the problem, then apply more reasonable constraints. In part 3, we will give a specific code solution. Part 4 discuss the results, and part 5 just summarizes the whole problem."

    "## 2. Mathematical model ##\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.A. Basic Model ###\n",
    "\n",
    "Assumption 1: we assume that flying from one city to another city takes exactly one day, and visiting one city takes exactly two days.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assumption 2: Price didn't change within adjacent several days.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assumption 3: Each city visit just once.\n",
    "\n",
    "First notice we will introduce the incidence matrix $ matrix \\in \\cal{R}^{v \\times e} $ in our model, where $v$ is the number of vertices or cities, and  $e$ is the number of edges, that is two times city number plus flight number(will explain why two time city number later), and $b$ is the supposed  The vector $edge \\in \\cal{R}^{e}$ is the edge choice. So apparently we can get these two contraints:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ matrix \\times edge == b$$, where b is the supposed in- or out- degree for each vertice or city.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ abs(matrix) \\times edge . \\le 2$$, which means the sum of in- and out- degree for each city should be less than or equal to two.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second we need to meet the time and cost limit. Suppose $city\\_choice \\in \\cal{R}^{v}$ is binary value vector, and $city\\_choice[i] = 1$ represents $city[i]$ will be visited, otherwise if $city\\_choice[i] = 0$ will not visit $city[i]$. Same idea for $flight\\_choice$ which represents whether or not taking $flight[i]$. So according to problem, we can get these two limits:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ flight\\_choice' \\times flight\\_price \\le total\\_money $$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ 2sum( city_choice) +  sum(flight\\_choice) \\le total\\_day $$\n",
    "\n",
    "We still have one question not solved, that is why we need $2 \\times city\\_number$. Please consider the graph below, we split each city node into two. The reason we do that is that, suppose $edge$ is composed only by the $flight$, and we meet the constraints. But still, we don't know which city will form a single circle, like the $city_A$ in this graph, which means in the adaptive method, we will detect only one circle( that is $city_B$ - $city_C$ - $city_D$) in the graph, which is absolutely wrong. That's why we want to split each city node into two, because it can help us find all possible circles or subtours in the graph, then applying adaptive method will be reasonable.\n",

    "To sum up, below is a standard form:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{aligned}\n",
    "\\underset{city\\_choose,\\, flight\\_choose}{\\text{maximize}}\\qquad& city\\_score' \\times city\\_choose + flight\\_score' \\times flight\\_choose \\\\\n",
    "\\text{subject to:}\\qquad& \n",
    "  matrix \\times edge == b \\\\\n",
    "& abs(matrix) \\times edge . \\le 2 \\\\\n",
    "& flight\\_choice' \\times flight\\_price \\le total\\_money \\\\\n",
    "& 2sum( city_choice) +  sum(flight\\_choice) \\le total\\_day \\\\\n",
    "\\end{aligned}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.B. Bounded Model ###\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we may come up with another idea: in a more realistic scenario, people will have an upper bound travelling day for each city, instead of exactly 2 days, which makes sense because someone just hope to visit several different cities within 2 week-holiday.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assumption: visiting day for each city will be bounded by a upper bound. And the delight index for visiting one city is calculated by the city score multiply by its corresponding visiting day.\n",
    "\n",
    "We introduct a new vector $day\\_each\\_city \\in \\cal{R}^{v}$, denoting the travelling day for each city, and its upper bound is $city\\_day\\_upperlimit$. So apparently we can get following relations:\n",
    "\n",
    "If $city\\_choice[i] = 1$, then $day\\_each\\_city[i] \\ge 1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "If $city\\_choice[i] = 0$, then $day\\_each\\_city[i] == 0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then applying the if-then constraint:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ day\\_each\\_city[i] - 1 \\ge m (1 - city\\_choice[i]) = city\\_choice[i] - 1$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ day\\_each\\_city[i] \\le M day\\_each\\_city[i] = city\\_day\\_upperlimit[i] \\times day\\_each\\_city[i] $$\n",
    "\n",
    "And also we notice that the upper bound for visiting each city $day\\_each\\_city \\le city\\_day\\_upperlimit$ is included in the second if-then constraint, so we don't have to explicitly demonstrate it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore the standard form for this is below:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{aligned}\n",
    "\\underset{city\\_choose,\\, flight\\_choose}{\\text{maximize}}\\qquad& city\\_score' \\times city\\_choose + flight\\_score' \\times flight\\_choose \\\\\n",
    "\\text{subject to:}\\qquad& \n",
    "  matrix \\times edge == b \\\\\n",
    "& abs(matrix) \\times edge . \\le 2 \\\\\n",
    "& flight\\_choice' \\times flight\\_price \\le total\\_money \\\\\n",
    "& 2sum( city_choice) +  sum(flight\\_choice) \\le total\\_day \\\\\n",
    "& day\\_each\\_city[i] - 1 \\ge city\\_choice[i] - 1 \\\\\n",
    "& day\\_each\\_city[i] \\le city\\_day\\_upperlimit[i] \\times day\\_each\\_city[i]\n",
    "\\end{aligned}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.C. Adaptive Method ###\n",
    "\n",
    "We apply the adaptive subtour elimination. Find subtours and the get the number of subtours. If the subtour number is bigger than one, then we add a constraint that this circle should not be reached, so that we can avoid having multiple circles in the graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "One key tip is that, in our model, since we start our trip from Madison, the out-degree of Madison will be 1, and in-degree of Madison will be -1, in which case this will not form a circle itself. So we have to manually search the subtour starting from the Madison at first in each iteration, so that we can find the very first route starting from Madison and back to Madison.\n",
